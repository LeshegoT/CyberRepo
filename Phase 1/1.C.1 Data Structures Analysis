The application uses the JSON format for API responses, as seen in the /admin route where simulated customer data is sent as a JSON string:

JavaScript

res.send(`<h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Customers table: (simulated)</p>
    <pre>[{"id":1,"name":"C. Example","email":"cust@example.test"}]</pre>
    ...`);
This is also evident in the ffuf_payloads.json file, where the output of the fuzzing tool is stored in JSON format.
