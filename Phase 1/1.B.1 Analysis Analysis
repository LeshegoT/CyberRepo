The static analysis of app.js revealed two critical logic flaws:

Password Check: In the /login route, the application performs a password check by directly embedding the user-provided username and password into a SQL query string.

JavaScript

const sql = `SELECT id,username FROM users WHERE username='${username}' AND password='${password}'`;
This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability and is not a secure way to verify credentials.

Authorization Check: The /admin route's authorization check is insufficient. It relies solely on a cookie named 'user' having the value 'admin'.

JavaScript

const user = req.cookies.user;
if (user !== 'admin') return res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
An attacker who compromises the 'admin' account or is able to manipulate their cookies could easily bypass this check.
